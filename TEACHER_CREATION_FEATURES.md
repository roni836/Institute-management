### 2. Email Notifications

  - Professional email template with Antra Institute branding

3. Choose password option:
   - **Auto-generate**: Check the box for automatic password generation and email
   - **Manual**: Uncheck the box to set password manually
4. If manual mode, enter and confirm password
5. Click "Save Teacher"

### Email Configuration:
Ensure your `.env` file has proper mail configuration:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@antra.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Antra Institute"
```

## Security Considerations
- Generated passwords are 10 characters long with mixed characters
- Passwords are hashed before storing in database
- Email includes security warning about changing password
- Plain password is only sent via email, not stored in logs
- Email sending failures are handled gracefully

## Future Enhancements
- Password strength indicator for manual passwords
- Email templates in multiple languages
- Bulk teacher creation with email notifications
- Password expiration reminders
